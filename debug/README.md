# Debug Folder

Use this folder for transferring logs and scratch files between machines.
Files in this folder are git-ignored except this README.

Common files to put here:
- `terminal.log` — console output from the server
- `adapter.log` — adapter container logs
- `casa-log.txt` — Aria Ops CASA service logs
- `validation.log` — mp-test validation output




The simplest test — just curl it from the machine that runs the adapter:


curl -s "https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices?\$filter=serviceName%20eq%20'Virtual%20Machines%20Dedicated%20Host'%20and%20armRegionName%20eq%20'usgovvirginia'%20and%20priceType%20eq%20'Consumption'" | python3 -m json.tool | head -30
That tells you two things at once:

Can the machine reach prices.azure.com
Does the region name format (usgovvirginia vs usgov virginia) return results
If you get results back, check the armSkuName values match what your hosts report as sku_name. If you get an empty Items array, try the spaced version:


curl -s "https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices?\$filter=serviceName%20eq%20'Virtual%20Machines%20Dedicated%20Host'%20and%20armRegionName%20eq%20'usgov%20virginia'%20and%20priceType%20eq%20'Consumption'" | python3 -m json.tool | head -30
If neither returns results, try dropping the region filter entirely to confirm the API is reachable:


curl -s "https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices?\$filter=serviceName%20eq%20'Virtual%20Machines%20Dedicated%20Host'" | python3 -m json.tool | head -30
If the machine can't reach prices.azure.com at all (timeout/connection refused), the air-gap is blocking it and we'll need to switch to a hardcoded pricing table instead.

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://management.usgovcloudapi.net/subscriptions/<SUB_ID>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/hostGroups?api-version=2023-03-01&\$expand=instanceView" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -i skuName



You already have both in your adapter's credentials:

Sub ID — it's in your connections.json (or visible in the Azure portal under Subscriptions)
Bearer token — your adapter's auth.py handles this. You can grab one quickly with a Python one-liner from the MP Builder server:

cd /opt/aria/Aria-MP-Builder/Azure/app
python3 -c "
from auth import AzureAuthenticator
auth = AzureAuthenticator('<TENANT_ID>', '<CLIENT_ID>', '<CLIENT_SECRET>', 'government')
print(auth.get_token())
"
Replace the three values from your connections.json. That prints a bearer token you can paste into the curl.

Alternatively, skip all that and just check what SKUs you have from the mp-test output. When you run a collect, the adapter logs should show the host groups and hosts it found. Or check the Aria Ops UI — go to your Azure adapter objects, find the Dedicated Host objects, and look at the sku_name property.

If none of those are convenient, you can also check the Azure Gov portal at portal.azure.us > Dedicated Hosts — the SKU is listed on each host.

cd /opt/aria/Aria-MP-Builder/Azure/app
python3 -c "
from auth import AzureAuthenticator
from azure_client import AzureClient
auth = AzureAuthenticator('<TENANT_ID>', '<CLIENT_ID>', '<CLIENT_SECRET>', 'government')
client = AzureClient(auth, 'government')
subs = client.get_all('/subscriptions', '2022-12-01')
print(f'Service principal can see {len(subs)} subscriptions:')
for s in subs:
    print(f'  {s[\"displayName\"]} ({s[\"subscriptionId\"]})')
"




The adapter_definition code looks correct — all object types have proper keys. The "resource key=, resource args=[]" error is coming from the Aria Ops server during pak installation, not from the adapter code itself.

This is likely a conflict with the existing v1.4.0 installation that's in a failed state. The clobber didn't fully clean up, so Aria Ops has stale/empty resource kind entries from the previous failed install attempt.

Try this sequence on the Aria Ops node:


# 1. Check current pak state
curl -k -u admin "https://localhost/suite-api/api/solutions" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A5 -i azure

# 2. Force uninstall the stuck pak via the API
TOKEN=$(curl -k -s -X POST "https://localhost/suite-api/api/auth/token/acquire" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD","authSource":"local"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token'])")

curl -k -X DELETE "https://localhost/suite-api/api/solutions/AzureGovCloud" \
  -H "Authorization: vRealizeOpsToken $TOKEN"

# 3. Restart CASA
sudo systemctl restart vmware-casa
Then wait a few minutes and do a fresh install of the v1.4.1 pak.

Important: deleting the solution via the API removes the adapter definition but your collected object data should persist in the datastore. When you reinstall with the same adapter kind (AzureGovAdapter) and the same object identifiers, Aria Ops will reconnect to the existing objects.
